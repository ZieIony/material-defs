# material-defs
Material Design color swatches, styles, typography and dimensions. All in one simple library project.

I was asked to extract some of the features of the Carbon library to separate projects so it's possible to include just one feature in one's app. This project is one of them. 

To include the lib follow the link: https://jitpack.io/#ZieIony/material-defs/03c741a7ab

For all features, demos, changelog and Maven support check out Carbon: https://github.com/ZieIony/Carbon
